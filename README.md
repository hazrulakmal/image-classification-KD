# Knowledge Distillation for Image Classification
Using knowledge distillation to improve lightweight CNNs model performance for image classification.

## Introduction

## Results

## To-do List
1. Create a baseline pipeline for training and evaluating models.
2. Save the models and results on weights and biases storage.
3. Create a pipeline for knowledge distillation.
4. create a notebook to show inferece on test sets. Load saved models and make inference on test sets.
